# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors During Project Start

This repository demonstrates a troubleshooting approach for uncommon errors encountered when starting an Expo project using `expo start`.  The error may manifest differently depending on the underlying cause, but the general principles remain the same. This example focuses on issues related to package versions and missing native modules.  Specific error messages and solutions will vary based on your project setup and environment.  Consult the Expo documentation for comprehensive troubleshooting.

## Error Reproduction (expoBug.js)

This section is intentionally left blank because the error is highly context-dependent.  Refer to your own project's error messages and the steps provided below. 

## Solution (expoBugSolution.js)

**1. Verify Package Versions:**

Use `npm ls` or `yarn why <package-name>` to investigate dependency conflicts or outdated packages. Resolve conflicts by updating or downgrading packages as necessary, ensuring consistency between package.json and package-lock.json (or yarn.lock).

**2. Check Native Modules:**

Ensure that all required native modules are correctly installed and linked.  Expo's documentation should be consulted to confirm this step for different modules. If using a module with native components (react-native-*, etc.), carefully follow its installation instructions.

**3. Clean and Rebuild:**

Sometimes cached files or build artifacts can lead to errors. Try cleaning the project's cache using the appropriate commands for your package manager (npm cache clean --force, yarn cache clean).  Reinstall your dependencies and rebuild the project.

**4. Emulator/Simulator Issues:**

If using an emulator or simulator, verify it's correctly configured and running. Restart the emulator/simulator. Check if there are any reported issues.  In some cases, creating a new emulator/simulator instance can resolve this.

**5. Expo CLI Updates:**

Ensure you have the latest version of the Expo CLI. Use `expo update` to update. 

**6. Environment Variables:**

Check for any environment variables in your project or system that might be conflicting with Expo's requirements.

**7. Project Configuration:**

Review your `app.json` and `package.json` files. Ensure that the project configurations are valid and that there aren't any typos or conflicting settings.

**8. Platform Specific Issues:**

The error may manifest differently on Android and iOS. If the error is only occurring on a specific platform, investigate platform-specific documentation and configurations for additional troubleshooting.
